## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning for text classification. The goal is to classify news articles as either fake or real using a logistic regression model trained on text data. The text data is transformed into numerical features using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).

## Requirements

The following Python libraries are required to run the project:

- `pandas`
